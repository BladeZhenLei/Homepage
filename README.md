Welcome to my homepage where I show all the fun things (in my opinion) about mathematics!

In my repos there are mixed things but mostly are about machine learning, finance, physics and maths.

Although I am still interested in some research parts of Graph Theory and Number Thoery, in here there will be nothing about serious maths.
