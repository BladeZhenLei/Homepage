Welcome to my Homepage!

In my repos there are mixed things about machine learning, finance, physics and maths.

Here I want to share some fun ideas (no serious maths) about Number Theory and Graph Theory research.

See

https://bladezhenlei.github.io/Riemann-Hypothesis/
<br/>
for posts about Riemann Hypothesis (Biggest Mystery in Mathematics). 

Also see

<br/>
for my archieves of mathematical art.
